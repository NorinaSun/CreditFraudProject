## Abstract

The problem of credit card fraud can have a major impact on enterprises. In real life, the prediction
model of credit card fraud detection has been widely used. However, different machine learning algorithms
also have a certain influence on the prediction process and results. This paper will focus on studying the
credit card fraud prediction of different models by evaluating four algorithms, including logistic regression,
random forest algorithm, k-nearest-neighbours classification algorithm, naive bayes classification algorithm,
to compare their training speed, prediction speed and accuracy for different training sets of different sizes.
We also compare how the model reacts to changes in data nature. Ultimately we seek to determine which
model is most suitable for a latency sensitive application such as credit card fraud. In this project, the basic
data set will be randomly generated using Monte Carlo simulation.
